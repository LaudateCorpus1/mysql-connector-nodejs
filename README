        }).then(function (collection) {
            return Promise.all([

                ).execute(),
                collection.find("$.baz.foo == 'bar'").execute(function (row) {
                    console.log("Row: %j", row);
                }).then(function (res) {
                    console.log("Collection find done!");
                }),
                collection.remove("($.foo.bar) == 'baz'").execute().then(function () {
                    console.log("Document deleted");
                }),
                collection.drop()
            ]);

            return session.dropSchema("test_schema");
        }).then(function () {
            return session.close();
